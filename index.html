            <h2>Find a friend for life</h2>

            <p>When pre-loved toys need a new home, they come to us.
                <br>
                We help them find a forever home with you so that you can make a new friend for life.
                <br>
                <br>
                We know each toy is different, just like us!
                <br>
                That's why we help you find the perfect fit for you and your home.
                <br>
                <br>
                Each toy comes with an adoption pack, including a certificate of adoption, and how to take care of your new friend.

                    Bella is one of the cutest bunnies around! She is very talkative and loves a good story.
                    <br><br>
                    As you can probably tell, her favourite colour is yellow, just like the sun! This is because she loves going outside.
                    <br><br>
                    In fact, one of her favourite things to do on a nice sunny day is to go searching for wonderfully coloured flowers!
                    <br><br>
                    With her positive energy and charming smile, Bella will always be there if you need somebody to talk to.

                    If there is anything that Goldie loves, it would have to be a good long nap.
                    <br><br>
                    He loves spending his days lounging around the house, cuddling up on the couch, and sleeping huddled up in bed.
                    <br><br>
                    He loves being stroked under the chin and behind his cute floppy ears.
                    <br><br>
                    One thing you should know is that with Goldie around you will never be lonely.
                    <br><br>

                    She is one of the softest and sweetest birds in the entire world, which means you will never want to be without her by your side.
                    <br><br>
                    She loves digging her beak into a nice book alongside a nice warm cup of tea.

                    When it comes to getting your hands dirty, Percy is your guy!
                    <br><br>
                    His most favourite thing to do is gardening, he loves spending his time in the garden growing all sorts of things from pumpkins to avocados!
                    <br><br>
                    After a long day of gardening, this little environmentalist likes to show off his cooking skills by making food with the produce he grows.
                    <br><br>
                    His food is loved by all, and he makes a pretty mean vegetable lasagna.

                    <br><br>
                    Aside from her love for candy, she also likes to spend time at the park, her favourite section would have to be the swings.
                    <br><br>
                    Another reason why she loves the park is that she likes to meet new people, and her bubbly personality means that she gets along with everyone she meets!
                    <br><br>
                    If you want a new best friend, Sally is the perfect candidate.

                    You may find him whizzing around the house, practising for his next race.
                    <br><br>
                    He may not be fast, but he is a dreamer. He always tries his best and that is just one of Toddâ€™s many great qualities!
                    <br><br>
                    On his days off of the racecourse, he likes to relax.
                    <br><br>
                    His favourite position to be in is on his back with his legs in the air! He loves a good tummy rub and lots of attention.

                    Kanako founded Friend4Life in 2015 when they saw the amount of pre-loved toys that were still in good condition being thrown away every year.
                    <br><br>
                    Friend4Life started as a small operation from Kanako's garage, but has since grew to become the organisation
                    we know and love today.
                    <br><br>
                    Since the conception of the organisation, Friend4Life has been awarded 10 awards and has rehomed over 5 million friends.
